# Landing

Unfortunately, Hermes was no longer a viable project, as the project's user niche was very small, and developing Hermes required a lot of effort and resources. This is why it was decided to close the project.

But Hermes is now Totepass! A platform inspired by Hermes that allows you to easily organise trips with your friends and family.

[Get started with Totepass â†’](https://totepass.com)
It's free! And creating an account takes less than 2 minutes.

PS: Code is [still here](https://github.com/travelhermes/hermes)_
